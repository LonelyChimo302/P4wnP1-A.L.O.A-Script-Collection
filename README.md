# What this is:
This is just a Repo to store my Scripts for the P4wnP1 A.L.O.A.
I broke my SD Card and had to do everything from scratch, so i might as well upload everything here as a backup if something goes wrong again.
Also i know how hard it is to find anything about this thing thats in good english, accessible and isn't an article.

Some of these will just be copy-pasted from other users, some will be slightly edited to my needs and some will be scripted from scratch.
I will try to Credit everyone i used code from, if i forgot someone and you recognize your code, just message me i will add credits.
