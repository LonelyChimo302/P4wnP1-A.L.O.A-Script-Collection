# DISCLAIMER: What you do with this is up to you, i only use this for pentesting my own stuff or the stuff of consenting friends and family. If you do anything Illegal with the scripts you found here, thats on your end.

# What this is:
This is just a Repo to store my Scripts for the P4wnP1 A.L.O.A.
I broke my SD Card and had to do everything from scratch, so i might as well upload everything here as a backup if something goes wrong again.
Also i know how hard it is to find anything about this thing thats in good english, accessible and isn't an article.

Some of these will just be copy-pasted from other users, some will be slightly edited to my needs and some will be scripted from scratch.
I will try to Credit everyone i used code from, if i forgot someone and you recognize your code, just message me i will add credits.

* I will probably add a Tutorial one day, since i find it infuriating how scarce the documentation and information on this thing is. I had some problems setting it up the first time and had to basically troubleshoot everything myself, because every tutorial out there just assumes that everything works great on your end.

# How to Use:
### PureHIDScripts:
* Just Copy Paste these into the editor on the P4wnP1s Http website under "HIDScript" and store them there

* Then just add a Trigger Action "USB gadget connected to host" (Can be something different depending on the Script, if not specified its usually this tho) ---> "start HIDScript *HID SCRIPT NAME*". Store that Trigger Action as something you can remember what its for.

* Next you want to go to "Generic Settings" and create a new Startup Template with your new Trigger Action selected. Store that too and then put it into the Startup Master Template

* Disconnect your device to shut it down and next time you connect it to a host it will start the HIDScript upon being recognized as an HID.
