# Scripts and what they do:

* This is just a summary tho, i'd highly recommend reading the comments in the actual code before using any of these.

## AndroidPINUnlocker:

* Should be fairly obvious, just plug your P4wnP1 into any Android Phone via OTG Adapter and it starts trying out predetermined PINs till you gain access to the Phone.

## RickRoll

* Even more self explanatory then the PhoneUnlocker. It will automatically play the Youtubevideo of Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" upon being recognized as an HID. This will work on any Windows PC (Tho i only tested this on WIN 10 and 11, WIN + R and typing in a Link should work on older WIN versions aswell)

## More soon
